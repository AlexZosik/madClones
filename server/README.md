Server completely being rewritten with microservices in mind.

So far there is a tello service and a users service(that will be used for authentication).

## Plan

### Architecture

Trello service linked to a mongo database
Users service linked to a mysql database

I will refactor and rethink the architecture as the server grows. Seperating domains and similar functional logic in micro services.
